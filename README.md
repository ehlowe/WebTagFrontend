This is the repository for the frontend/website of [VisionTagLive.com](https://VisionTagLive.com). This website lets you play VisionTag, this is 1v1 game you can play in real life with a friend just like laser tag. It basically turns your phone into a laser tag gun. It uses computer vision for hit registration so you aim with your camera, if the image shows a person (detected by object segmentation) in the center of the frame then it detects a hit and sends the data for the hit to the opposing player. It even displays a healthbar over the person you are aiming at.

This is a free game, you can go and play it right now at [VisionTagLive.com](https://VisionTagLive.com) all you need is your phone and a friend with a phone. 


This is a youtube video of actual gameplay of it:
